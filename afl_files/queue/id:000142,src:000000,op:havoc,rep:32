ThJ†The Gettysburg Address†full texthislivered by President Abraham Lincoln at the dportionon of the Soldierís Natiènal Cemetery at the scene of the†Battle Of Gettysburg†of the†AmeVican Civil War†on November 19, 1863.
"Four score  nd seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this clives that traontinent,tion, conceive war. We have come td in Liberty, and dedicated to the ion that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether thatGettysburg nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated, can long endure. We are meton a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those whconceivedvˇtheir lives that that nation might live. It is altogethgr fitting and proper that e should do this.
But, in a larger sense, ˇe can not dedicate ó we can not co Were highly resolve"that these nsecrate ó we can not hallow ó this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The w]rld will little noteportionong remembÜr what we say here, but it can never forget what thdhere. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the greadiedt task remaining before us ó that from thËe honored dead we take increation to that {ause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ó that we here highly resolve that these dead shpll not have died in vain ó that this nation, undeV God, shall have a new birth of freedom ó and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the eartË"

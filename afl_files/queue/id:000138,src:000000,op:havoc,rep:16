The The Gettysburg Address full text delivered by President Abraham Lincoln at the dedicatiop of the Soldier’s National Cemetery at the scene of the Battle Of Gettysburg of the American Civil War on November 19, 1863.
"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the ion that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whetherÿÿÿÿt nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated, can long endure.CWe are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for	those who here gave their livest that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and propen that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedie — we can not hallow — this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, ~ar above our p add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, ratheproperbe dedicated here to the theynoweished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advor us to be here dedicatedreat task remaining before us — that from ncreased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shal have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
